My professional path has taken afew twists and turns - from elearning & leadership trainings to full stack web developement. Creativity is what makes this jump very welcoming to me and I can say very clearly that I love what I do. \n\nWith my two most impotant traits, passion and hardwork, I have been able to volunteer several hours a week for community service. Whenever possible, I spend my time for Sreeshti, a non-profit organzation, as a Logistics and Media Secretary and raise funds and provide service to people in need. My current project is to help people in NJ for the biggest cause COVID19."
